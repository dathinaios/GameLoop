DESCRIPTION::

GameLoop is a library for the creation of virtual sound environments inspired by video game techniques.footnote::The design of the library was based on the article 'The Guerrilla Guide to Game Code' that can be found at http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2280/the_guerrilla_guide_to_game_code.php::

The library includes:
LIST::
## UGens for spatialisation according to cartesian or polar coordinates using Ambisonics  
## Classes implementing Steering Behaviours. 
## A  spatial index for efficient collision detection (SpatialHashing),
