The idea of steering behaviours can be traced back to Craig Reynolds’ 1987 paper link::http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1987/boids.html##'Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model’::. In this paper Reynolds describes an algorithm that produces a beautiful simulation of flocks. Reynolds elaborates on this concept in the paper link::http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1999/gdc99steer.html##‘Steering behaviors for autonomous characters’:: where he presents a comprehensive collection of behaviours ranging from casual motion around a space to complex group formations. In his own words, the ‘paper presents solutions for one requirement of autonomous characters in animation and games: the ability to navigate around their world in a life-like and improvisational manner’.

If you are interested to know about these methods (or even better would like to implement a few more for GameLoop) a useful resource can be found in the book 'Programming Game AI by Example' by Matt Buckland. This was my main resource for the GameLoop implementations as well.
