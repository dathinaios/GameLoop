related:: Overviews/Gameloop_Overview, Reference/SteeringBehaviors

DESCRIPTION::
Designed to produce a steering force that will give the impression of a random walk through the agentâ€™s environment. You will either need to read the implementation FOOTNOTE::If you are interested to know about these methods (or even better would like to implement them) a useful resource can be found in the book 'Programming Game AI by Example' by Matt Buckland.:: or experiment with it to get a sense of what the values are doing. I suggest both!

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new

ARGUMENT:: entity
the entity on which the steering force will be applied

ARGUMENT:: wanderRadius
the radius of the constraining circle

ARGUMENT:: wanderDistance
the distance the wander circle is projected in front of the agent

ARGUMENT:: wanderJitter
the maximum amount of random displacement that can be added to the target each second

INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: value
Get the calculated force. To be used in the .force_ method of the entity. This is how the steering forces are applied.
